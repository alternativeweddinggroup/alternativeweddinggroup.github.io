Want to plan your own wedding but not sure where to start?  Planning an alternative, quirky or cross cultural wedding day? Our interactive sessions provide you with all of the necessary information and tools needed to plan your perfect wedding. We will go through each step of wedding planning from engagement to check list for the night before the wedding.

Learn how to create a realistic wedding budget, what mistakes not to make when booking a venue, how to find the perfect caterer, how to keep on top of all of your tasks and everything else you need to know. There is also a section focused specifically on cross cultural weddings, how to integrate cultural traditions and cultural sensitivities.

We will also provide you with a list of recommended suppliers tailored specifically to the type of wedding you are planning.
Expect to receive guidance and material regarding marriage preparation, stress management, dealing with wedding fallouts and more. Upon completion of our master-class you will be fully equipped for the adventures ahead.
