We believe that weddings are productions! The venue is the stage & the bridal party the main characters. We organise breath-taking weddings that truly represent the non-conformist couple.

We (Truchio Powell & Daniella Ogunbanjo), founded the organisation in 2014 due to our dissatisfaction with the lack of wedding services specifically for inter-racial, cross cultural & cultural modern couples. With over twenty years&rsquo; collective experience coordinating high quality corporate and social events, we decided to use our expertise to service the underrepresented bride & groom.

Our experience in coordinating *inter-racial*, *cross cultural & cultural modern weddings* enables us to provide an *authentic*, *bespoke* service for unconventional couples seeking an exceptional wedding experience. We also have a passion for coordinating *quirky* and *unusual weddings* to an incredibly high standard. Our weddings are show-stopping and memorable for everyone involved.

We believe that every couple should be able to have their dream day their own unique way and we go to great lengths to bring these dreams to life. We therefore only work *with trusted suppliers* and *partners*. *Integrity* is at the centre of everything we do & our clients can always be confident that we will deliver above and beyond what is expected.

Whether you envisage an intimate, modern, wedding with a cultural twist or an elaborate, quirky, extravaganza, we will *listen*, *visualise* and bring your dreams to life in *spectacular style*. We promise to take your breath away. Most importantly, we will do all of this so you don&rsquo;t have to!
